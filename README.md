# Shapes for haptic experiments

##### v 1.4

[![Screen Shot 2011-09-29 at 3.03.57 PM](https://academics.skidmore.edu/blogs/flip/files/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2011-09-29-at-3.03.57-PM-300x278.jpg)](https://academics.skidmore.edu/blogs/flip/files/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2011-09-29-at-3.03.57-PM.jpg) In 2004, a student of the vision laboratory, Morgan Casella, started a project on line drawings and 3D shape perception. We created a class of objects that used structured randomness (known in the computer graphics community as ‘noise’) in a systematic way, by varying frequency and therefore ‘complexity’. An initial set of 25 objects was created and used in his thesis. We printed a few of them at a scale of about 20cm^3 and used those as drawing models. 

Later, Eric Egan used golf-ball sized, 3D printed and cast versions of the 25 stimuli for crossmodal haptic experiments. In those experiments we were able to identify a subset of the objects such that each are haptically 1 JND apart. They are ordered in terms of perceptual complexity. 

Subsequently, these objects have been used in a variety of experiments in our laboratory involving cross-modal perception. 

This set of 8 objects start with an object in the 'middle' of the original 25 (a shape we call, for no apparent reason, _Golden Boy_) and step through them in 1 JND intervals.

The name 'Glaven' was coined by Martin Voshell, a very early vision lab alum, and is based on the Jerry Lewis / Nutty Professor style interjections of Professor John Frink of the Simpsons. Frink is the official laboratory mascot. 

The original objects were generated using a custom set of software routines in  [Wolfram Mathematica](http://wolfram.com). We prepared this set for 3D printing with Autodesk [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com). We are making the scan data available here for use by the research community. Please cite our dataset —
